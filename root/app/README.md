# App

Here are located all helper scripts and dependencies written to help user with tasks. All scripts are located in `bin` directory, scripts with functions only, which are used in multiple other scripts are located in `lib` folder.  

Every script **MUST** start with **ovpn_** prefix, so it can be easy identified that script belongs to this project. Please write guide how to use your script, so users will be able to use it without checking source code and give a lot of examples.
